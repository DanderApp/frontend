// Require all dependent modules here, just like any node.js project.
var blerg = require('./dependent')

// Invoke them here.
// We'll probably have things like
//   makeAJAXCall()
//   handleLikeClick()
//   handleFacebookShare()

// We won't have very much code here, just invocations of functions declared elsewhere.


// A little demonstration:
console.log('It works!!!')
blerg()
