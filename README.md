# Dander Luv

Front-end client for those of us nipped by puppy love.

## Staging site
The staging site is deployed [here](https://dander.firebaseapp.com/).

## Usage
First, run:

```npm install```
This will install all dependencies listed in package.json.

Then:

```npm start```
This rebuilds the 'public' folder, which contains the files for the publicly accessible site. It then runs browser-sync, which monitors the source files and reloads the browser when anything changes. After running ```npm start``` you should see a link to the locally hosted site in the terminal.

To quit browser-sync, hit control-c.
